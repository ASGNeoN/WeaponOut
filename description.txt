NOTE: WeaponOut.json has been moved into the (Mod Configs/) folder.

A compilation of features built around weapons and accessories. A lot of these are basically gimmicky systems that do cool stuff.

Summary: 
* Hide/Show weapons being held with inventory icon (top left).
* Temporary spawn point tents! Silk + Wood.
* Whips! Deals crits when hitting at the tip.
* Fists! Duck and weave, then deliver that killer combo.
* Dual-use Weapons! Right-click for secondary weapon abilities.
* More shields! Obtainable early, with situational uses.
* Team-centric items for buffing, and restoring mana.
* Endgame powerup accessories! Make low tier weapons lunar.
* Custom config file, if you want to toggle the above features.

Content:
* 9 Whip Weapons
* 33 Fist Weapons
* Quite a few other weapons
* 15 Accessories (I think)
* 1 Tile
* 3 Bullets
